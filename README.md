Easy to use Unity's GameObject Auto Rotate Control.

</div>




Too tired of creating a simple rotating animation for a single gameobject and then realizing that you need to create the same animation on another gameobject?
</br>
Me too, that is why I created this simple to use Auto Rotate Control script.

## Functions

* Add as many objects that you want to rotate together.

* Assign keys to rotate and reset the rotation.



## Getting Started
* Add as many objects that you want to rotate together in the same script by adding them to the Object To Rotate list.

* If you want to rotate the object/objects on key press, simply check the Key Press Enable and select the keys you wish to use.

## Usage
